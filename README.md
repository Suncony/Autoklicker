# Autoklicker

A simple, multi-keys autoclicker I made because I was bored.

The Autoklicker features:
- Autoclicking all mouse and keyboard keys (maybe controller keys too if you know their names).
- Hold mode (default): Hold to trigger Autoklicker, release to stop.
- Toggle mode: Press to trigger Autoklicker, press again to stop.

The manual is included in the program so check it out.

Made with AutoHotkey lmfao.
